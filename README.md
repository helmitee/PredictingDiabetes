<h1>Predicting Diabetes - ML Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A group project of 2 students. In this project, we use machine learning to predict the occurrence of diabetes. The report covers different aspects, including defining the problem, comparing machine learning methods, and analyzing the results. In Section 2, we explain the problem and provide information about the data we used. Section 3 discusses two machine learning methods we considered: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. In Section 4, we present the results, and Section 5 contains our conclusions based on those results.
